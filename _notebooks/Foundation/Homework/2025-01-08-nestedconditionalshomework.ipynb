    "You and your friend want to do different things at the amusement park. To decide, you do a coin flip. Heads means that you get to choose where to go and tails means that your friend gets to choose. If you go on a ride, be sure to check if you are the right height and have enough tickets, and if you go to a food stand, make sure that you have enough money and that the food is in stock. Be creative, and make sure to use nested conditionals!"
